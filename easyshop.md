### Easy Shop

Build an app that allows a user to buy items from multiple shops and track their spending.

#### MVP

* The app should allow the user to see their funds
* The app should allow the user to view multiple shop inventory's
* The user should be able to view specific categories of items
* The app should display all the transactions a user has made in a single view,

#### Inspired by:

Monzo, MoneyDashboard, lots of mobile/online banking apps

#### Possible Extensions

* add a shopping cart to add multiple items at once
* The user should be able to supply a budget, and the app should alert the user somehow when when they are nearing this budget or have gone over it.
* The user should be able to filter their view of transactions, for example, to view all transactions in a given month, or view all spending on groceries.
