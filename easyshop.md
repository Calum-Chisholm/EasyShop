### Easy Shop

Build an app that allows a user to buy items from multiple shops and track their spending.

#### MVP

* The app should allow the user to see their funds
* The app should allow the user to view multiple merchants inventory's
* The app should display all the transactions a user has made in a single view
* The app should allow the user to buy a product from a specific merchants inventory

#### Inspired by:

Amazon, Ebay, Go Compare

#### Possible Extensions

* Add a category to each product to search by category
* Add a search/filter 
* add a shopping cart to add multiple items at once
* The user should be able to supply a budget, and the app should alert the user somehow when when they are nearing this budget or have gone over it.
* The user should be able to filter their view of transactions, for example, to view all transactions in a given month, or view all spending on groceries.
